HOW A BILL BECOMES A LAW

The Legislative Process in the United States Congress

1. INTRODUCTION

- Bills can originate in either chamber (except revenue bills - House only)
- Bills are designated HR (House) or S (Senate) plus a number

2. COMMITTEE ACTION
- Bills are referred to appropriate committees based on subject matter
- Committees may hold hearings to gather information
- Committee marks up (amends) the bill
- Committee votes to report the bill, table it, or take no action

3. FLOOR ACTION
- Reported bills are placed on calendar
- Leadership schedules floor consideration
- Chamber debates the bill
- Amendments may be offered
- Chamber votes on final passage

4. SECOND CHAMBER
- Process repeats in the other chamber
- If passed without changes, goes to President
- If passed with changes, differences must be resolved

5. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
- Members from both chambers negotiate differences
- Compromise version created
- Both chambers must pass identical version

6. PRESIDENTIAL ACTION
