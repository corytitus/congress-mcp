## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Cloud (Choose One)

#### Option A: Railway (Recommended - Easiest)
```bash
# Steps:
1. Create account at https://railway.app
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Create new project from repo
4. Add environment variables:
   - CONGRESS_GOV_API_KEY
   - GOVINFO_API_KEY
   - ENACTAI_API_TOKEN (generate secure token)
5. Deploy and get public URL
```

#### Option B: Render 
```bash
# Steps:
1. Fork repository to your GitHub
2. Sign up at https://render.com
3. Create new Web Service
4. Connect GitHub repo
5. Use Dockerfile.remote
6. Add environment variables
7. Deploy
```

#### Option C: Digital Ocean App Platform
```bash
# Steps:
1. Create Digital Ocean account
2. Create new App
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Use provided app.yaml configuration
5. Add environment variables
6. Deploy to production
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop for Remote Access

Once deployed, update Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "customConnectors": {
    "enactai-data-remote": {
      "name": "EnactAI Legislative Data",
      "url": "https://your-deployed-url.railway.app/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Priority Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **Deploy to Railway** (easiest, good free tier)
2. **Set strong ENACTAI_API_TOKEN** 
3. **Test with Claude Desktop custom connector**
4. **Monitor API usage** to stay within rate limits

### For Development:
1. **Keep using local enhanced server** for testing
2. **Add more comprehensive error handling**
3. **Implement request retry logic**
4. **Add structured logging**

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these to measure deployment success:
- [ ] Remote server accessible via public URL
- [ ] Claude Desktop successfully connects
- [ ] All 14 tools working without errors
- [ ] Response times under 2 seconds
- [ ] Zero API rate limit violations
- [ ] Proper source citations in all responses

## üîß Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly:
- Check API rate limit usage
- Review error logs
- Update dependencies if needed

### Monthly:
- Rotate API tokens
- Review and optimize caching strategy
- Check for Congress.gov/GovInfo API updates

### Quarterly:
- Update legislative process educational content
- Review and update Congress overview data
- Performance optimization review

## üìù Configuration Checklist

Before going to production:
- [ ] API keys securely stored in environment variables
- [ ] Bearer token configured for authentication
- [ ] CORS properly configured for your domain
- [ ] Rate limiting tested and configured
- [ ] Health checks responding correctly
- [ ] Logging configured appropriately
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Cache TTL optimized for your use case

## üö® Important Notes

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to repository
2. **Rate Limits**: Congress.gov = 1000/hour, plan accordingly
3. **Caching**: Current TTL is 5 minutes, adjust based on needs
4. **Security**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for API errors and rate limits
